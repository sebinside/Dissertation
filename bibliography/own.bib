Despite ample work on "taming" uncertainty, the research community has devoted little attention to the systematic representation, analysis, and mitigation of uncertainty propagation and interaction ({UPI}) in adaptive systems. To address this oversight, we introduce Uncertainty Flow Diagrams, a notation that captures key {UPI} aspects. We demonstrate the use and benefits of our novel notation on Znn.com, an adaptive news site infrastructure.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-031-66326-0_21},
	abstract = {The growing interconnection between software systems increases the need for security already at design time. Security-related properties like confidentiality are often analyzed based on data flow diagrams ({DFDs}). However, manually analyzing {DFDs} of large software systems is bothersome and error-prone, and adjusting an already deployed software is costly. Additionally, closed analysis ecosystems limit the reuse of modeled information and impede comprehensive statements about a system’s security. In this paper, we present an open and extensible framework for data flow analysis. The central element of our framework is our new implementation of a well-validated data-flow-based analysis approach. The framework is compatible with {DFDs} and can also extract data flows from the Palladio architectural description language. We showcase the extensibility with multiple model and analysis extensions. Our evaluation indicates that we can analyze similar scenarios while achieving higher scalability compared to previous implementations.},
